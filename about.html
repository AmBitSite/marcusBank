                    lending, funding, short term investments, fixed income investments, securities, credit, gift, and
                    pay card services, and operating services. Our officers are knowledgeable with in depth experience

        <div class="row-1 col-md-6 col-gray visElem">
            <p>Our services are accessible through our state-of-the-art international network system which is a fully
                secured network for transmitting private and corporate information while ensuring that business
                transactions are performed without delay.</p>

            <p>MIB BANK has taken a number of important steps to ensure the security of our banking clients. Using
                industry leading technology standards and highly attuned human verification processes, MIB BANK provides
                a transparent and secure banking environment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row-2 col-md-6 col-gray visElem">
            <p>Unlike major money center banks who have straight through processing (STP), our trained staff manually
                processes all outgoing transactions. This human verification process gives you an additional level of
                protection from electronic hacking. The knowledge of our clients combined with strong AML training
                substantially reduces the chances for fraudulent activity within your account.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row-2 col-md-6 col-gray visElem">
            <p>The bank utilizes 256bit SSL encryption certificates to protect all client sensitive material. Our
                software is PCI compliant and follows the latest in online security practices. Our servers offer
                triple-redundancy protection to ensure your information is always available. We offer clients the
                ability to communicate through PGP encrypted email, or internal virtual messaging to further our privacy
                offering.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row-3 col-md-12 col-gray visElem">
            <p>While you may not know it, one of the biggest risks to banking clients is not online fraud, but the
                fractional reserve banking system. MIB Bank holds a 100% deposit ratio and is a transactional only bank.
                The bank makes no loans and does not engage in leverage or speculation with client assets</p>
